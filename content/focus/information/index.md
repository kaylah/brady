*IMPACT Focus* is a powerful, cost effective and easy-to-use hospital decision support benchmarking tool that replaces *Quick Check*. It provides instant on-line password access to department staffing benchmarks from IMPACT, the field’s most powerful and trusted benchmarking database, when there isn’t time to engage in a large scale time-consuming "project."

Just a five percent improvement in productivity can produce annualized cost savings of better than one million dollars in a small critical access hospital and five million dollars or more in a typical mid-size urban community hospital.

*IMPACT Focus* is the perfect resource for hospitals and systems that need to quickly establish, calibrate, or refine departmental workload-based productivity management standards. Now you can instantly determine the range of paid and productive hours per unit of service actually used in leaner, well-managed departments with similar workloads in hospitals that share your institution’s characteristics. Whether yours is a short-term acute care hospital with an ADC between 3 and 450 or a critical access hospital, *IMPACT Focus* will successfully generate peer group reports more than 90% of the time.

To get started, just send us an <a href="mailto:info@bradyinc.com?subject=Impact%20Focus">e-mail</a> and we’ll send you everything you need to begin. There is no learning curve.  You provide a minimal amount of hospital and department data and we do the rest.  Turn-around time is very fast. You will receive your reports usually before the end of the next business day.

For assistance, please call (816) 587-2120 during normal business hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday, except on holidays.
