Frank Brady, President of Brady & Associates, began a life-long pursuit in 1971 when he managed a field-test of techniques to measure and improve organizational effectiveness in the clinical setting under the auspices of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). That experience provided the unique insight into performance-limiting factors around which our services are designed.

Frank served as CEO in community, Catholic and proprietary hospitals before founding Brady & Associates in 1983. His articles have appeared in the _Organizational Effectiveness_ newsletter and in _Health Progress_, the Official Journal of the Catholic Health Association of the United States. He is a frequent speaker at HFMA-sponsored events and has served as a consultant to consultants for such internationally recognized firms such as The Lewin Group, Aeon Hewitt, and McKinsey & Company. For more than thirty years Brady & Associates has supported the management initiatives of more than 750 hospitals of all sizes, missions and ownership types throughout the U.S. as well as in Europe, Canada and the Middle East. The firm employs data, systems thinking, and change management principles to maximize organizational effectiveness. Frank holds a Masters degree in Health Services Administration from the University of Missouri at Kansas City. The father of five children, he and his wife Donna live in Kansas City.
