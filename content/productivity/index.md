## IMPACT Staffing Review

Our IMPACT benchmark database contains validated staffing and activity information from more than 750 hospitals, 304 department types, and 24,000 hospital departments. Services range from an on-site organization-wide staffing review to a quick analysis of staffing practices in selected departments. With IMPACT you can:

* Develop, calibrate and adjust department-level workload-based staffing standards.
* Track workload-based productivity, hours worked to hours paid ratios, and overtime use.
* Identify cost reduction opportunities. Small improvements will produce tremendous cost savings. A productivity improvement of only five percent in just four departments (ICU, ED, Laboratory, and a Medical/Surgical Nursing Unit) will produce annualized cost savings in excess of $647,000 in a typical mid-size community hospital.
