              <h2>Organizational Solutions</h2>

              <p>Today’s hospital must be able to effectively plan, direct, organize and control resources. Most importantly, it must have the ability to react quickly when changes occur. If the hospital’s structure contains too many layers, or if there are span of control issues, it will not be able to do so.</p>

              <p>Genuine and potentially very significant opportunities to increase net revenue and reduce expenses are available to hospitals that act to reorganize business lines, realign reporting relationships, and rethink corporate structures. Current and projected revenue and expense trends have created a perfect storm that makes taking action critically important. To learn more about how you can put IMPACT Organizational Solutions to work in your hospital, send us an <a href="mailto:info@bradyinc.com?subject=Info%20about%20Organizational%20Solutions">e-mail</a> or call (816) 587-2120. We will be glad to schedule a conference with your senior management team to help you determine if our services are a good fit for current priorities.</p>
