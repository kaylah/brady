Benefis is the product of a merger that occurred in 1996. At the time with the merger it was imperative for Benefis to achieve significant cost reductions. Since we just represent over half of the cost of a typical hospital, establishing productivity standards and making improvements in the area of employee product productivity was a very high priority. To help in establishing standards and practices to implement productivity guidelines, Benefis engaged Brady \u0026 Associates to evaluate and help establish standards for each of the departments within Benefis. The standards were based on a database of information from Brady \u0026 Associates and work customized to address the various unique and unusual situations within some of our departments.\r\n\r\nThe process of establishing standards and implementing an overall productivity system was a difficult and challenging task however it was successfully accomplished, with significant credit going to Brady \u0026 Associates for their hard work, professional attitude, and extensive experience and database information.\r\n\r\nBenefis has maintained its productivity system and standards through the years, and I am happy to state that our productivity and the use of the productivity system are functioning well within our organization.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend Frank Brady and his organization for any projects or efforts associated with achieving productivity standards and or improvements, and I know he will do an excellent and professional job.\r\n","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wayne Dunn"},"itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"Brady \u0026 Associates Hospital Consultant"},"datePublished":"06\/15\/2004","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","ratingValue":"5.0","worstRating":"1","bestRating":"5"}}</script>
