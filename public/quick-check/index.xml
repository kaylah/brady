      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick Check is the most powerful, cost effective and easy-to-use hospital decision support benchmarking tool available from any source. It provides instant world-class real world staffing standards information when there isn’t time to engage in a large scale time-consuming &amp;ldquo;project.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.profileaccess.com/HRC/ReportView.jsp?Request=727463&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;See an example report here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Productivity management matters. Just a five percent improvement in productivity can produce annualized cost savings of better than one million dollars in a small critical access hospital and five million dollars or more in a typical mid-size urban community hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick Check is the perfect resource for hospitals that need to quickly establish, calibrate, or refine departmental workload-based productivity management standards. Now you can instantly determine the range of paid and productive hours per unit of service actually used in leaner, well-managed departments with similar workloads in hospitals that share your institution’s characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether yours is a short-term acute care hospital with an ADC between 3 and 450 or a critical access hospital, IMPACT will successfully generate peer group reports more than 90% of the time. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bradyinc.com/pdfs/Quick%20Check%20Department%20List.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;See a complete list of Quick Check’s departments here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply provide a standard set of basic information about the hospital during set up. Then select the department type from a menu, and enter department workload for the period (visits, examinations, billed tests, etc). IMPACT selects peers to match against both hospital and department-level characteristics from the more than 700 hospitals in our proprietary database of validated staffing and activity information. Selection criteria include type, size, setting, teaching status, case mix, and workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your hospital is already an IMPACT Plus or IMPACT Operations Monitor client and you want to interact with Quick Check directly, access is provided at no cost through your service agreement. Just enter through the “subscriber entrance”, login using the Quick Check user ID and password supplied by Brady &amp;amp; Associates to enter your data and run your reports at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not yet a client, Quick Check access is available to you through our no risk honor system.  Just download the form at this &lt;a href=&#34;http://bradyinc.com/pdfs/IMPACT%20Quick%20Check%20Data%20Input%20Template.xlsx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, complete it with the requested information, and send it to us via e-mail. If after 30 days you don’t believe your staffing review was worth its $150.00 total cost, just let us know and we’ll unconditionally waive the fee. Otherwise we’ll invoice you for the $150.00.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will run your reports. You will receive an e-mail containing an embedded link to your reports usually before the end of the next business day. You may view your reports in their native format on line or save them in PDF format.
